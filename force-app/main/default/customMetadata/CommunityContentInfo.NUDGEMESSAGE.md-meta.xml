&lt;br /&gt;
Your wellbeing is important to us and we know how critical it is that you get time off from work to rest and recharge. Even though various COVID restrictions mean that we may not be able to travel far from home, don&amp;rsquo;t put it off!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
You are receiving this message because you have accrued a high amount of annual leave. We want to work with you to get you the break you deserve!&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
What&amp;#39;s the next step?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
